Execution strategy
These options affect how Bazel will execute the build. They should not have any significant effect on the output files generated by the build. Typically their main effect is on the speed of the build.

--spawn_strategy=strategy
This option controls where and how commands are executed.

standalone causes commands to be executed as local subprocesses. This value is deprecated. Please use local instead.

sandboxed causes commands to be executed inside a sandbox on the local machine. This requires that all input files, data dependencies and tools are listed as direct dependencies in the srcs, data and tools attributes. Bazel enables local sandboxing by default, on systems that support sandboxed execution.

local causes commands to be executed as local subprocesses.

worker causes commands to be executed using a persistent worker, if available.

docker causes commands to be executed inside a docker sandbox on the local machine. This requires that docker is installed.

remote causes commands to be executed remotely; this is only available if a remote executor has been configured separately.
