-c dbg
These options affect the build commands and/or the output file contents.

--compilation_mode (fastbuild|opt|dbg) (-c)
    The --compilation_mode option (often shortened to -c, especially -c opt) takes an argument of fastbuild, dbg or opt, and affects various C/C++ code-generation options, such as the level of optimization and the completeness of debug tables. Bazel uses a different output directory for each different compilation mode, so you can switch between modes without needing to do a full rebuild every time.

    fastbuild means build as fast as possible: generate minimal debugging information (-gmlt -Wl,-S), and donâ€™t optimize. This is the default. Note: -DNDEBUG will not be set.

    dbg means build with debugging enabled (-g), so that you can use gdb (or another debugger).

    opt means build with optimization enabled and with assert() calls disabled (-O2 -DNDEBUG). Debugging information will not be generated in opt mode unless you also pass --copt -g.
