memory.stat file includes following statistics

# per-memory cgroup local status
cache		- # of bytes of page cache memory.
rss		- # of bytes of anonymous and swap cache memory (includes
		transparent hugepages).
rss_huge	- # of bytes of anonymous transparent hugepages.
mapped_file	- # of bytes of mapped file (includes tmpfs/shmem)
pgpgin		- # of charging events to the memory cgroup. The charging
		event happens each time a page is accounted as either mapped
		anon page(RSS) or cache page(Page Cache) to the cgroup.
pgpgout		- # of uncharging events to the memory cgroup. The uncharging
		event happens each time a page is unaccounted from the cgroup.
swap		- # of bytes of swap usage
dirty		- # of bytes that are waiting to get written back to the disk.
writeback	- # of bytes of file/anon cache that are queued for syncing to
		disk.
inactive_anon	- # of bytes of anonymous and swap cache memory on inactive
		LRU list.
active_anon	- # of bytes of anonymous and swap cache memory on active
		LRU list.
inactive_file	- # of bytes of file-backed memory on inactive LRU list.
active_file	- # of bytes of file-backed memory on active LRU list.
unevictable	- # of bytes of memory that cannot be reclaimed (mlocked etc).

# status considering hierarchy (see memory.use_hierarchy settings)

hierarchical_memory_limit - # of bytes of memory limit with regard to hierarchy
			under which the memory cgroup is
hierarchical_memsw_limit - # of bytes of memory+swap limit with regard to
			hierarchy under which memory cgroup is.

total_<counter>		- # hierarchical version of <counter>, which in
			addition to the cgroup's own value includes the
			sum of all hierarchical children's values of
			<counter>, i.e. total_cache
